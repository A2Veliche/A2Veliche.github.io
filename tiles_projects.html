						<article id="feeder">
							<h2 class="major">Automatic Cat Feeder</h2>
							<p>While on vacation for a few days, I needed a way to keep our cat fed on a daily basis. I decided to quickly fabricate a cat feeder out of materials I found in my garage. The idea was to use a rotating disk and an equally-compartmentalized cylinder. Each compartment holds a cat's daily ration of food, and every 24 hours, the disk rotates into position under that compartment to let the food fall through by its own weight. This contraption would be mounted above the cat bowl.</p>

							</span>
							<p> After an initial round of brainstorming, I modeled the idea in SolidWorks, making sure to size the components according to the stepper motors and pieces I already had on hand. The rotating disk would be secured by the screw-on lid of the plastic container, and all sliding surfaces would be lubricated to prevent them from seizing up.</p>

							<p> For the axle which connects the large gear to the disk I used a wooden dowel on which I press fit everything else (and sanded it where it needed to rotate freely). I also 3D printed the two gears which increased the torque from the motor.</p>

							<p> The final step was to put the prototype to the test. The house was cold during our departure, so although the stepper motor heated up to around 120 degrees Fahrenehit due to several days of powered use, it didn't burn out in the end.

							<h2 class="major">Machining</h2>
							<p>I have been working as a Junior Machinist at the Forsyth machine shop on Northeastern's campus since the spring of 2021. Here are a few projects during which I have employed most of my machining knowledge and learned more.</p>

							<h3>Aesthetic Spinning Top</h3>
							<p> The idea was to make a top which would make a satisfying desk toy but also demonstrate the possibility of joining multiple material types into a solid object. As an increased hardness of the point of contact leads to decreased fricitonal losses, a stainless steel core was used, while a brass exterior provided the aesthetic. Pressfittng the two cylinders together was a process of trial and error. Initially, they were simply pressed together using a bench press with no thermal processing and this resuled in unfavorable cavities to form in between the steel and brass pieces. Later, with the second attempt, the brass piece was heated up with a blowtorch while the steel was cooled with liquid nitrogen. This allowed the former to expand and the latter to contract, resulting in much tighter tolerances at room temperature.</p>

							<h3>Benchtop 2-in-1 Toolpost </h3>
							<p>When inserting a cutting tool in a 5C collet (used on the Tormach mills), the collet needs to be secured in place while a torque wrench is used to tighten it properly. The challenge was to design a toolholder to hold 2 different collet sizes as to economize for space on the worktable.</p>

								<p style="text-align:center"> Designing the toolholder by sketching. A requirement is to accomodate 2 different collet sizes.</p>
							</span>
							<p>The 1/4 in steel pieces were first waterjet, then press fit, and then welded together. The difficulty was finding the right tolerances for the tab and slot features, but this was solved after two iterations.</p>

							<p>In the end, this in-house solution performed better and more reliably than Tormach's collet closers. This project is open source, and the part/DXF files can be found <a href="https://github.com/A2Veliche/A2Veliche.github.io/projects/toolholder/distribute">here</a>.</p>

						<!-- Inverted Self-Balancing Pendulum -->
						<article id="pendulum">
							<h2 class="major">Self-balancing inverted pendulum</h2>
							<h3>Inception</h3>
							This project first started at an engineering summer camp taught by MIT Professor Alex Slocum where we were instructed to find a problem and apply the FUNDAMENTAL principles of design to the entire process. This project grew into a larger robotics endeavor where I learned PID control alrogithms, electronics, machining, prototyping, felxure design, and acquired many more analytical skills.</p>

							<h3>Description</h3>
							<p>An inverted pendulum is an inherently unstable system becasue gravity is not a restoring force but an applied force that coerces the pendulum to a stabler equilibrium (where it is hanging like a normal pendulum). To keep the pendulum in equilibrium, a restoring force must be applied. One way to do this is by accelerating the pendulum's refrence frame and making use of Newton's 2nd law, "F=ma". Using only one degree of freedom, the falling mass may be kept in its original position despite external disturbances which may cause perturbations. There are many YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjhAAQexzLg">videos</a> featuring these types of machines and how they work.</p>

							<h3>Functional Requirements</h3>
							<p>To fit on a benchtop, the linear stage needed to lay horizontal, and it required a sliding carriage on which to secure the pendulum mechanism. For coolness points, the pendulum had to carry an object up to 1kg in mass while in balance. This meant that the pendulum assembley had to be rigid enough to withstand the load, and the DC motor powerful enough to accelerate the pendulum to the necessary velocities. This also meant that the linear stage needed to be long enough to allow for large displacements of the pendulum base in case it needed to deccelerate gradually. The mathematical model for the inverted-pendulum system is simple but it is also highly nonlinear, so sensing and feedback loop control is required to keep it at a constant angle.</p>

								<p style="text-align:center"> Using a Python script and physics simulation to approximate the maximum power draw of the motor.</p>
							</span>

							<h3>Limitations</h3>
							<p>The main limiting factor was my budget. I didn't want to spend more than $300 on the entire assembly so only the most essential precision components were purchased from McMaster-Carr. This included the precision ground steel rods and the teflon bearings which were cheaper than regular ball bearings. With no initial machining/engineering experience, the first attempts lacked the necessary precision tolerances. This lack was compensated for through the use of built-in flexures on the rail carriage. Another limitation was physical space. This was a machine which needed to be portable and take up little space on the benchtop, but also be large enough to handle with normal garage tools. Finally, it needed to be safe enough to poke with a finger (and demonstrate enternal perturbations), so safety measures had to be integrated into the design as well.</p>

							<h3>Brainstorming and Design</h3>
							<p>The first step was to sketch ideas and think of all the possible ways to satisfy the functional requirements within the limitaitons. The options were narrowed down once a few benchtop models were whipped up using LEGO technic pieces. Afterwards, the next stage was to CAD model everything in SolidWorks and Fusion 360, and further simplify the design while making sure to consult with peers. The final design concept was kept throughout the building stage, only the individual component layout and structure changed dramatically. Consider the evolution from 2018 to 2021 shown in the images below.</p>

							<h4>Component: Flexured Carriage</h4>

							A large issue during the building and design phase was that the components used are tight toleranced and any displacment causes enormous stresses that bind up the carriage motion. Therefore, mechanical flexures, are used to decrease the spring constant of various motion components and reduce the stresses casued by load-induced strains. I kept an engineering notebook all along to record my progress and figure out formulas.

								<p style="text-align:center"> Figuring out the tolerances in the linear carriage, and the optimal flexure design to accomodate them.</p>
							</span>

							The most important flexures on the machine are ones which hold the linear bearings in place and are attached to the carriage body. The flexures account for misalignment errors of the two rods relative to each other, as well as how the carriage blocks are attached to the carriage chassis.

							Initially these were to be waterjetted out of aluminum bar stock, but the more economical choice of 3D printing them won out in the end.

								<p style="text-align:center"> 3D printing the flexure mounts to be used on the bearing blocks.</p>
							</span> -->

							Another important flexure in the carriage assembly is the carriage chassis itself which compensates for the vertical misalignment of the two carriage blocks. Becasue of the limitations of how the bearing flexures are able to bend, this flexured chassis makes up for the lost degree of freedom.

							<h4>Component: Belt Tensioner</h4>

							There had been a couple iterations for the belt tensioner which would pull the two ends of the timing belt together and also be secured in a recess of the linear carriage. The first design involved a platw which would pull down a small belt section which interloccked with the two loose ends and pulled them towards the center. This worked fine until the belt section gradually deformed and loosened up, thereby losing its tension.

								<p style="text-align:center"> Designing and installing the first belt tensioner.</p>
							</span>

							The second belt tensioner was build out of aluminum stock and steel bolts so that it would be capable of applying much larger tensions with minimal installation work. This required lots of manual machining and failures (wrong speeds/feeds, broken tap, insufficient tolerancing, etc.), but in the end it came out great.

						<h3>Results</h3>

						As of now, the linear stage is up and running. There is a PID loop running through an Arduino-Uno which takes in encoder data from the motor and adjusts the motor input voltage accordingly. The motor that is used is a <a href="https://www.vexrobotics.com/217-3371.html">VEX Mini Cim motor</a>, and the motor controller is a <a href="https://www.vexrobotics.com/217-9191.html">Talon SPX</a>. You can <a href="https://youtu.be/iQwe4ZnMEd0">see a video</a> of the linear stage being controlled by a potentiometer position.
						In the near future I hope to get the pendulum installed and another fedback loop running through the Arduino to monitor its angular position. Then I will be able to control the pendulum setting a position and letting the machine balance itself!
